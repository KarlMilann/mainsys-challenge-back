Hi everyone, for this springboot project, i used :
- JRE 11
- maven 5.4.0-48
- A MySQL database in localhost:3306
  username: root
  password: rootroot
  
  if you want to fill the database, i've made 2 files in src/main/resources to create and fill the database with a random dataset.
  the password for the second user (the one bind with all Sales objects) has the credentials { 'username' : 'user', 'password' : 'useruser' }
  
- this server is in localhost:8080 by default.
